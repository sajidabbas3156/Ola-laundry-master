# üóÑÔ∏è Shared Database Architecture - All Apps Connected

## ‚úÖ YES - All 4 Apps Share One Database

**Database**: PostgreSQL with **31 tables**
**Apps**: Customer, Driver, POS, Admin - all connected to the same data

---

## üîÑ How It Works

## üîê Data Security & Access Control

### **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
Each business is completely isolated:
```sql
-- Every table has tenantId for separation
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE tenantId = 'oasis-laundry';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE tenantId = 'downtown-cleaners';
```

### **Role-Based Access**
Different apps see different data based on user role:

**Customer (Mobile App)**:
```sql
-- Only see own orders
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customerId = currentUser.id;
```

**Driver (Delivery App)**:
```sql  
-- Only see assigned deliveries
SELECT * FROM delivery_routes WHERE driverId = currentUser.id;
```

**Staff (POS System)**:
```sql
-- See all business data for their tenant
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE tenantId = currentUser.tenantId;
```

**Admin (Dashboard)**:
```sql
-- Full access to tenant business data
SELECT * FROM * WHERE tenantId = currentUser.tenantId;
```

## ‚ö° Real-Time Data Flow

### **Example: Order Lifecycle**

1. **Customer places order** (Customer App)
   - Writes to `orders` and `order_items` tables
   - WebSocket notifies all connected apps

2. **Order appears in admin dashboard** (Admin App)
   - Reads from same `orders` table
   - Admin assigns to staff or driver

3. **Driver gets delivery assignment** (Driver App)
   - Reads from `delivery_routes` table
   - Updates delivery status in real-time

4. **Customer sees live updates** (Customer App)
   - Reads updated order status
   - Receives push notifications

### **All Apps Stay Synchronized**
- One app updates data ‚Üí All apps see changes instantly
- WebSocket connections keep everything in sync
- No data duplication or inconsistency

---

## üéØ Why This Architecture Works

### **Business Integration**
- Order flows: Customer ‚Üí Staff ‚Üí Driver ‚Üí Admin
- All parts of business need same data
- Real-time coordination essential

### **Data Consistency**
- Single source of truth
- No sync issues between apps
- Immediate updates across platform

### **Efficiency**
- One database to maintain
- Shared connection pooling
- Faster queries and performance

### **Scalability**
- Add new apps easily

## üåç Multi-Business Support

The same database supports multiple laundry businesses:

**Tenant A: "Oasis Laundry" (Bahrain)**
- 150 customers using Customer App
- 5 drivers using Driver App  
- 8 staff using POS System
- 2 managers using Admin Dashboard

**Tenant B: "Downtown Cleaners" (Dubai)**
- 300 customers using Customer App
- 8 drivers using Driver App
- 12 staff using POS System
- 3 managers using Admin Dashboard

Each business is completely isolated but uses the same app infrastructure.
